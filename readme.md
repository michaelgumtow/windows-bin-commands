# Steps for Using These Commands

1. Create a folder on your machine to keep these in.
2. Put that folder in your path, by opening the Start Menu, and searching for "Environment Variables". 
3. Press "Enter" on the option that says "Edit the System Environment Variables".
4. Click "Enviroment Variables" at the bottom of the window that opens up.
5. Under User varibles (the top part of the window), find the variable called "path", and click edit.
6. Likely as not you probably already have a couple of files in your path. Create a new variable to put into your path, and put the full location of the folder you created earlier.
7. Restart your terminal (cmd / PowerShell), and you should now be able to use the commands in the folder.
